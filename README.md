# book-notes
A place to hold notes I've taken while reading books for fun and self-improvement. These are to be used for my personal notekeeping, and contain unmarked direct quotes/grammatical errors.

## Contents:
- ***Smarter_Faster_Better_Notes.md*** : *Smarter, Faster, Better* by Charles Duhigg. A book about productivity, mostly anecdotal, but an enjoyable read.
