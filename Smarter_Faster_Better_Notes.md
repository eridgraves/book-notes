# Notes on "Smarter Better Faster" by Charles Duhigg

## Chapter 1: Motivation
- We are driven by our "Locus of Control"
- The idea that we have control (even if we don't) gives us motivation to continue a task
- We must prove to ourselves that our choices are meaningful. Ask "Why?" at the start of a new task, both in good and bad situations.
- This gives each part of a task larger motivation, and emotionally rewards us in an outsized manner when compared to the tasks. A small task may seem unimportant, but we need to be convinced that it is part of a larger project that we believe in.  

## Chapter 2: Teams
- Interactions between team members are more important to team performance as a whole than individual skills.
- Successful teams divide speaking time relatively evenly among members.
- Successful leaders of teams make sure that everyone speaks in meetings.

## Chapter 3: Focus
- Our brains like to use mental models to understand unexpected situations
- These models can let us get trapped in a "cognitive tunnel" of an improper mental model
- Force yourself to anticipate possible situations in your daily life
- Practice strengthens our mental models, and puts us firmly in charge of a situation

## Champter 4: Goal Setting
- ToDo lists are good, but can limit the thinking of an individual/organization.
- Setting unrealistic goals (i.e. run 200m in 10sec) can also limit thinking.
- Combine these two methods for optimal goal-setting:
    1) What is your stretch goal?
    2) What are specific sub-goals? (proximal goals)
    3) How will you measure success?
    4) Is this achievable?
    5) What is your timeline?

## Chapter 5: Managing Others
- Study found that successful startups were structured as "Culture of Commitment" -- that the organization has a duty to ensure the wellbeing of its employees
- Employees work smarter and better when they believe they have more decision-making authority and when they believe their colleagues are committed to their success.
- Organizations with decentralized decision making can make anyone into an expert, but will undermine their knowledge without their trust in the organizations as a whole.
- There are drawbacks to this structure: a small group of employees can ruin the entire company

## Chapter 6: Decision Making
- We are good at making decisions with very little information, but the accuracy of these depends on how right our assumptions are.
    - Get the right assumptions by exposing yourself to a full spectrum of experiences
-

## Chapter 7: Innovation
- Jump start the creative process by taking proven, conventional ideas from other settings and combine them in new ways
    - Highest impact scientific papers were found to be combinations of existing methods in new ways
    - "Idea brokers" are middlemen who go between areas (often in companies) with ideas
- We're more likely to recognize discoveries hidden in our own experiences when necessity pushes us, when panic or frustrations cause us to throw old ideas into new settings.
- When strong ideas take root, it can become hard for competitors to emerge
    - Sometimes, you need to disturb things to let these new ideas be discussed. (As in changing structure of a team slightly) To keep from spinning in place.
- Creativity cant be a formula, but the Creative Process can be managaed formulaically to let creativity flourish.
- Tips to being an Idea-Broker:
    1) Be sensitive to your own experiences. How do things make you think and feel?
    2) Panic and stress while creating is the condition that makes us flexible enough to seize new ideas, not a sign that things are falling apart.
    3) Relief when finding breakthrough can also blind us from seeing alternatives. Try to maintain some distance from what you create to keep from tunnel-visioning.
- Creativity is just problem solving. Trust yourself, and let the ideas flow.


## Chapter 8: Absorbing Data
- Data can be transformative, but only if people use it.
- Passive absoption of data (as in receiving results through a computer), is dramatically less impactful than when you are forced to engage with the data (as in by had graphing)
- "Data Blindness" is the inability to make use of the data around us. A large factor of which is the overwhelming number of sources.
- Our brains crave 2-3 choices, when faced with more, we break information into smaller pieces (a process called "winnowing"), and then get lost in indecision.
- One way to deal with Data-Blindness is to force ourselves to engage by breaking the decision into smaller choices (red or white whine? expensive or cheap?)
- When information is made disfluent, we learn more (if we actually engage at all)
- Successfull people transform the data they receive to make it testable, and then iterate on ideas resulting from it


## Author's Summary

- Motivation:
    - Becomes easier when we transform a chore into a choice. DOing so gives us a sense of control.
    - Self-motivation becomes easier when we see our choices as affirmations of our deeper goals.

- Goal Setting:
    - A Stretch Goal to spark big ambitions.
    - A SMART goal to form a concrete plan. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timeline)

- Focus:
    - Aid focus by building mental models - telling ourselves stories - of what we expect to see.

- Decision Making:
    - Envision multiple futures, and then force yourself to figure out which is most likeyl, and why.
    - Get experiences, perspectives, ideas, from others to hone our Bayesian instincts.

- Make Teams More Effective:
    - Manage the how, not the who. (psychological safety)
    - If leading, think of what messages your choices reveal. Aim to shape the team with your influence here.

- Manage others productively:
    - Employees work better when given more decision-making authority AND they believe that their collegues are committed to their success
    - Push decision making to the person closest to the problem to take full advantage of available knowledge.
    - People need to know that their suggestions wont be ignored and their mistakes not held against them.

- Encourage Innovation:
    - Merge old ideas in new ways.
    - Be sensitive to your own experiences. How do things make you think and feel?
    - Panic and stress while creating is the condition that makes us flexible enough to seize new ideas, not a sign that things are falling apart.
    - Relief when finding breakthrough can also blind us from seeing alternatives. Try to maintain some distance from what you create to keep from tunnel-visioning.

- Absorb Data better:
    - Force yourself to do something with new data that you receive: write it down, graph it, explain it to a friend.
